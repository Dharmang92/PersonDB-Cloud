## MongoDB

MongoDB Collection is represented by Model in our code. 💹
In this collection we have series of records/objects. All of them having a unique id. 🔑

## Schema

Schema governs the inside of any of the records/objects. (How it is structured) 🔒✔️

## Mongoose

It adds a layer of methods to easily save, edit, retrieve and delete **(CRUD Operations)** data from MongoDB. 👍
Allows us to create our Models and Schemas easily.
